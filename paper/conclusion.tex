\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we observed that Naïve Bayes and the Hoeffding Tree with Naïve
Bayes leaves were the best classifiers for Datastream Human Activity
Recognition.  We also discovered that the Hoeffding Tree and the MCNNs were
more resilient to a drift that the others.  We learn that a memory-bound has an
important impact on the classification performances of the Mondrian Forest,
to the point where it cannot learn nor adapt to a drift.  Finally, we found out
that the classifier used does not have an impact on power consumption.

The next step of this study will be to decrease the memory dependency of the
Mondrian Forest and to improve its runtime to make it more competitive with
classifiers such as the Naïve Bayes or the Hoeffding Tree.

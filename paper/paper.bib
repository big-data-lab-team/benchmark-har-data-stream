	abstract="Traditional tools for mining the big data have become insufficient due to ever-growing data in the world. For handling big data, real-time and distributed processing is adopted. From so many mining tools options, it can be difficult for a researcher to opt an efficient tool. This paper is intended to aid the researcher who understands WEKA but is inexperienced with big data. The preliminary stage of data mining is classification, which categorizes the data into predefined groups. In this paper, WEKA with MOA package is used to classify big data stream with four different classifiers. Performance of these classifiers is analyzed on the basis of accuracy, i.e., correctly and incorrectly classified instances, time taken to test the model, and time taken to build the model. For this particular scenario, obtained results prove that naive Bayes is the most accurate classifier and decision stump is least effective classifier for big data.",

	abstract="During the last 5 years, research on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has reported on systems showing good overall recognition performance. As a consequence, HAR has been considered as a potential technology for e-health systems. Here, we propose a machine learning based HAR classifier. We also provide a full experimental description that contains the HAR wearable devices setup and a public domain dataset comprising 165,633 samples. We consider 5 activity classes, gathered from 4 subjects wearing accelerometers mounted on their waist, left thigh, right arm, and right ankle. As basic input features to our classifier we use 12 attributes derived from a time window of 150ms. Finally, the classifier uses a committee AdaBoost that combines ten Decision Trees. The observed classifier accuracy is 99.4{\%}.",

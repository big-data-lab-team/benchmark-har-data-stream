The Internet of
Things is a concept in which a wide variety
of objects are connected to the Internet to
provide new services.  The
type of objects that can be connected could be a
watch\footnote{\url{https://www.apple.com/watch/}}
as well as a street light~\cite{smart-lamp-2011}
or a basic sensor. A sensor is a very small device
designed to detect events in its environment such
as temperature, humidity, or acceleration.  The
sensor is said wearable when it is incorporated
into clothing or worn as an implant. These objects often
embed a wireless communication system like wifi
or Bluetooth.  Finally, they can be
connected to Internet directly, with their own IP
address, or indirectly, through another connected
object such as a phone.

%Example of use
Connected objects can be used in various
situations.  For instance, a network of street
lights can be designed to keep a high feeling of
security while minimizing energy consumption.  On
the other hand, wearable sensors that gather data
about human activity, as described
in~\cite{recofit}, can be leveraged to improve
athletes performances and health. 
As a concrete example, the Motsai company develops
the Neblina, a wearable device as small as a coin
that incorporates nine motion sensors with 64KB
of main
memory\footnote{\url{http://docs.motsai.com/Neblina/Neblina_Module/V2/Datasheet.html}}.
This wearable sensor is designed to track and
analyze human motion.

The current pipelines that process data from
connected appliances are centralized, as
illustrated in~\cite{recofit}.  Data are produced
on a device, then transmitted to a centralized
cloud or a laptop where they are stored and turned
into a proper dataset. Then, the dataset is used
to extract useful information in an offline
manner.  The extraction is qualified as offline
because it starts once all data are collected. For
instance, when training a Machine Learning model,
the data are gathered then carefully curated to select
the best features. Then the model is trained and
tested on the data set.

To tackle these privacy and battery issues,
algorithms with small memory footprint were
developed to mine information directly on the
devices rather than in a centralized cloud.  These
algorithms were inspired of Big Data, in
particular, from data stream algorithms because it
is common for these fields to handle more data
than available resources can accommodate.
Designing such method allow transmitting only the
relevant data to the cluster. The survey
in~\cite{kejariwal2015} reviews the problems faced
by connected devices.


In this paper, we evaluate the learning of
data stream classifiers applied to Human
Activity Recognition (HAR) in order to provide insights
about which algorithm to choose regarding the
situation.  This study evaluate the classification
performances as well as the resource usage (power
and memory). In particular, we want to observe any
relation between ressources and classification
performances.

The work in \cite{memory_consumption_machine_learning}
explores the memory consumption and
the runtime of many R classifiers. The conclusion proposes different ways to
limit the overhead related to the implementation of the R module.

\cite{Janidarmian_2017} is an extensive study that
observes offline classifiers' performance with
wearable sensor data. This study shows high
accuracy using a K-fold validation and good
accuracy when using subject-independent
cross-validation. It also explores different
sensor placement as well as different window
sizes. The conclusion states that KNN is the most
stable classifier across sensor placement and
window size. Additionally to the classification
performances, the study also analyzes the
trade-off between runtime and efficiency.

\cite{omid_2019} studies the feasibility of
running classifier directly on wearable sensors.
The paper focuses on a comparison between a
Feedforward Neural Network~(FNN) and a K-nearest
neighbor~(KNN). It shows that a trained neural
network achieves high accuracy and performs better
than KNN. The dataset was acquired with the
Neblina, a wearable sensor placed on the right
forearm. The data from the Nebline was merged to
send to the computer a stream of 9-axis. Only
then, the stream was processed to extract features
and feed the classifier.

These three studies compared classification
performances, runtime, and resource usage of many
classifiers. Two of them use wearable sensor data
and one focuses on runtime and memory usage.
However, none of them is applied to data stream
situations because they either rely on K-fold
validation or cross-subject validation.
Additionally, these papers do not compare energy
consumption. The only mention of energy is made in
\cite{omid_2019} where the consumption is assumed to be
constant. Therefore, only the runtime affects 
energy consumption, and reducing the runtime
reduces the energy needed.

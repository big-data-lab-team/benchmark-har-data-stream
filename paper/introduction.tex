\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this paper, we evaluate the performances of
data stream classification algorithms to provide
insights about which algorithm to choose regarding
the situation.
This evaluation check the classification
performances as well as the resource usage (energy
and memory).

		\item Low-level environment, wearable device
		\item Embedded with OS functions unavailable
		\item Human Activity Recognition.
		\item Expend "regarding the situation" to talk about IoT.
		\item concept drift.

\subsection{Related Work}
\cite{memory_consumption_machine_learning}
explores the memory consumption and
the runtime of many R classifiers. The conclusion proposes different ways to
limit the overhead related to the implementation of the R module.

\cite{Janidarmian_2017} is an extensive study that
observes offline classifiers'
performance with wearable sensor data. This study shows high accuracy using a
K-fold validation and good accuracy when using subject-independent
cross-validation. It also explores different sensor placement as well as
different window sizes. The conclusion states that KNN is the most stable
classifier across sensor placement and window
size. Additionally to the
classification performances, the study also analyzes the trade-off between
runtime and efficiency.

\cite{omid_2019} studies the feasibility of running classifier directly on
wearable sensors. The paper focuses on a comparison between a Feedforward
Neural Network~(FNN) and a K-nearest neighbor~(KNN). It shows
that a trained neural network achieves high
accuracy and performs better than KNN. The dataset
was acquired with the Neblina, a wearable sensor
placed on the right forearm. The data from the
Nebline was merged to send to the computer a
stream of 9-axis. Only then, the stream was
processed to extract features and feed the
classifier.

These three studies compared classification
performances, runtime, and resource usage of many
classifiers. Two of them use wearable sensor data
and one focuses on runtime and memory usage.
However, none of them is applied to data stream
situations because they either rely on K-fold
validation or cross-subject validation.
Additionally, these papers do not compare energy
consumption. The only mention of energy is made in
\cite{omid_2019} where the consumption is assumed to be
constant. Therefore, only the runtime affects 
energy consumption, and reducing the runtime
reduces the energy needed.

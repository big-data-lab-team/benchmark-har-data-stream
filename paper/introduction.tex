%\cite{sensor-energy-consumption} (conclusion, second paragraph) communication uses more energy.
%\cite{leach} and \cite{sensor-energy-model}(page 3, first column, check equations and values)
%\cite{sensor-network-survey} : "Since the sensor nodes are often inaccessible, the lifetime of a sensor network depends on the lifetime of the power resources of the nodes"

%Maintenance problems (not necesserly related to the pipeline.)
